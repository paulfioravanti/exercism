# Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question.

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him.

He answers 'Calm down, I know what I'm doing!' if you yell a question at him.

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying
anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

Bob's conversational partner is a purist when it comes to written communication and always follows normal rules regarding sentence punctuation in English.
