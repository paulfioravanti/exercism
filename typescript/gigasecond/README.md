# Gigasecond

Given a moment, determine the moment that would be after a gigasecond
has passed.

A gigasecond is 10^9 (1,000,000,000) seconds.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for TypeScript to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript/installation)

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xit` to
`it`.
