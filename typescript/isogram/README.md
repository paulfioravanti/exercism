# Isogram

Determine if a word or phrase is an isogram.

An isogram (also known as a "nonpattern word") is a word or phrase without a repeating letter, however spaces and hyphens are allowed to appear multiple times.

Examples of isograms:

- lumberjacks
- background
- downstream
- six-year-old

The word *isograms*, however, is not an isogram, because the s repeats.

## Setup

Go through the setup instructions for TypeScript to install the necessary
dependencies:

[https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript/installation](https://exercism.io/tracks/typescript/installation)

## Requirements

Install assignment dependencies:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

## Making the test suite pass

Execute the tests with:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

In the test suites all tests but the first have been skipped.

Once you get a test passing, you can enable the next one by changing `xit` to
`it`.
