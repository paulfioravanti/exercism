# Exercism

A repository for exercises I've completed on [Exercism][].

I've made sure to submit all my solutions up to Exercism itself, and so
you can find all of them on [my Exercism profile][].

## Blog Posts

While creating local development environments for solving Exercism problems, I
made sure to keep notes, and ended up documenting my processes in the following
blog posts:

- _[Setting up a Ruby development environment for Exercism][]_
- _[Tmuxinator for Exercism][]_
